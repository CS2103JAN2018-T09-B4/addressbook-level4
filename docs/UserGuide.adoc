_NUSCouples_ provides you with a space to write, save and view journal entries. The list of saved journal entries will

 2018 will have a title of `20180305 - journal`. If an entry with that date already exists, it will open
that entry in the window. Saving is not required as the journal entry will be automatically saved when the
journal window is closed. +

[NOTE]
If saving fails, a new window will appear containing your last session data with a warning above your text. You should
copy your text to your computer clipboard using kbd:[ctr] + kbd:[c] so you will not lose your data if you need to

== FAQ

=== Data
This section is for questions related to _NUSCouples_ data. For more information, refer to <<Saving the data>> +

*Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?* +

*A:* Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data folder it creates with the folder that contains
the data of your previous NUSCouples folder. +

*Q: Why is the app not showing my previous session data?* +

*A:* Verify that the .jar file was not moved to a new directory recently. If you have done so, ensure that the data
folder in the original directory was moved to the new directory. For example, if you have moved _NUSCouples_.jar from
`C:\Program Files (x86)\NUSCouples` to `C:\Users\[Username]\Desktop\NUSCouples`, you should move the data folder
`C:\Program Files (x86)\NUSCouples\data` to `C:\Users\[Username]\Desktop\NUSCouples\data` +

If the files in the data folder have been manually edited, _NUSCouples_ may not be able to read the data properly.
_NUSCouples_ takes no responsibility for data loss/ data corruption due to unintended user behavior affecting the data
folder, such as deletion or editing of files manually. +

If the solutions above are not related to your issue, it may be due to a bug. Please contact us at //CONTACT US
and attach the log file that should be stored in the same location as the _NUSCouples_.jar file. The log file is named
`_NUSCouples_.log.0`. The number at the end may be different. If there are multiple log files, you should attach the
*latest* one or attach all of them to be safe. +
